Lunch Haus is a simple lunchtime clearing house for the office (or school, or
home, or... the moon? No, no restaurants there as far as I know.)

Lunch Haus is a Rails 3 app.  Simply install it, create some users, fill in the
details of your favorite local restaurants and menu items, and you're good to
go!  If you want something to eat, but don't feel like getting it, place an
order and cross your fingers!  If you're going somewhere to eat and feeling
helpful, check to see if there are any orders you could fill on the way!  Later
on, Lunch Haus will tell you how much you owe and who you need to settle up
with.

# Setup

This app runs on Postgres locally. It can be a little funny. You'll probably
need to manually create your user and databases:

    createuser lunchhaus
    createdb -Olunchhaus -Eutf8 lunchhaus_development
    createdb -Olunchhaus -Eutf8 lunchhaus_test
